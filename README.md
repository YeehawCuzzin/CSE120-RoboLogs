# RoboLogs: Smart NLP-based Log Summarization Tool for Enhanced Debugging

## Overview

RoboLogs is a research and development project by Omron Robotics and Safety Technologies, Inc. The system applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to robot-generated logs in order to automatically analyze and summarize errors, warnings, and other critical events.

Robot logs are often verbose and difficult to interpret quickly. RoboLogs addresses this by parsing logs, extracting key information, and producing concise, human-readable summaries. The tool aims to reduce debugging time, highlight recurring issues, and improve overall system observability.

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Log Parsing
- Identify key elements: timestamp, log level (ERROR, WARN, INFO), module, and message  
- Use Python libraries to read and extract structured information from plain-text logs  

### Phase 2: NLP Processing
- Classify and group messages using keywords  
- Extract and prioritize error and warning messages  
- Apply NLP libraries (spaCy, nltk, scikit-learn) for tokenization and entity recognition (e.g., service names, error types)  

### Phase 3: Summarization Output
- Implement basic summarization techniques (e.g., TextRank or other extractive methods)  
- Produce concise summaries of critical issues and recurring patterns  

### Phase 4: Cross-Log Debugging and Error Correlation (Optional)
- Synchronize multiple log files  
- Correlate errors occurring across different sources at the same time to provide unified debugging insights  

### Phase 5: User Interface (Optional)
- Build a simple command-line or web-based interface  
- Enable engineers to upload log files and receive automated summaries and reports
